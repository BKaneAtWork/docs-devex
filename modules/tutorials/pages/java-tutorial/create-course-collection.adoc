== Create the Course Records

Creating course records is similar to creating student records.
To create course records:

. In your `java` directory, create a new file called `InsertCourses.java`.
. Paste the following code block into your `InsertStudent.java` file:
+
[source, java]
----
import com.couchbase.client.java.Bucket;
import com.couchbase.client.java.Cluster;
import com.couchbase.client.java.Collection;
import com.couchbase.client.java.Scope;
import com.couchbase.client.java.json.JsonObject;

import java.time.Duration;

public class InsertCourses {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect("localhost",
                "Administrator", "password");

        Bucket bucket = cluster.bucket("student-bucket");
        bucket.waitUntilReady(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
        Scope scope = bucket.scope("art-school-scope");
        /*
            The code is similar to creating a student record, but it writes to
            a different collection.
        */
        Collection course_records = scope.collection("course-record-collection");    

        addCourse(course_records, "ART-HISTORY-000001", "art history", "fine art", 100);
        addCourse(course_records, "FINE-ART-000002", "fine art", "fine art", 50);
        addCourse(course_records, "GRAPHIC-DESIGN-000003", "graphic design", "media and communication", 200);

        cluster.disconnect();
    }

    private static void addCourse(Collection collection, String id, String name,
                                  String faculty, int creditPoints) {

        JsonObject course = JsonObject.create()
                .put("course-name", name)
                .put("faculty", faculty)
                .put("credit-points", creditPoints);

        collection.upsert(id, course);

    }
}
----
+
. Open a terminal window and navigate to your `student` directory.
. Run the command `mvn install` to pull in all the dependencies and rebuild your application.
. Run the following command to insert the student record into the collection:
+
[source, sh]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="InsertCourses" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
----
+
. Go to your Couchbase cluster in your browser and check the `course-record-collection` for the new course records you just added.

== Troubleshooting

When connecting to the database and creating a student record, you might get errors in your console.

* If you get an authentication error, confirm that the username and password in your `InsertCourses.java` file match the username and password you used when setting up the Couchbase cluster in your browser.
* If you get the error `DnsSrvLookupFailedEvent`, which tells you to specify an IP address, go to your `InsertCourses.java` file and replace `localhost` with the IP address of your local Couchbase Server.
* For any other errors, run `mvn install` and try the original command again.

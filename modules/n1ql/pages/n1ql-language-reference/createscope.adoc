//namespace::
//(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] of the bucket in which you want to create the scope.
//Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
//If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

//bucket::
//(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the bucket in which you want to create the scope. 
//The name of the database's bucket is the same as the database id. You can get this from the `dbid=...` section at the end of the URL if you are using the Web Console. 
//For example the URL `https://cloud.couchbase.com/...dbid=my-db-1tqei3` has the bucket name `my-db-1tqei3`.

//scope::
//(Required) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the name of the scope that you want to create.
//Refer to {naming-for-scopes-and-collections}[Naming for Scopes and Collections] for restrictions on scope names.

=== IF NOT EXISTS Clause

The optional `IF NOT EXISTS` clause enables the statement to complete successfully when the specified scope already exists.
If a scope with the same name already exists within the specified bucket, then:

* If this clause is not present, an error is generated.

* If this clause is present, the statement does nothing and completes without error.

== Example

====
This statement creates a scope called `events` in the database.

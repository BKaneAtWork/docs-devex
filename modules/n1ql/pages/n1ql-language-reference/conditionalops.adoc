Simple case expressions allow for conditional matching within an expression.
The evaluation process is as follows:

* The first WHEN expression is evaluated.
If it is equal to the search expression, the result of this expression is the THEN expression.
* If it is not equal, subsequent WHEN clauses are evaluated in the same manner.
* If none of the WHEN expressions are equal to the search expression, then the result of the CASE expression is the ELSE expression.
* If no ELSE expression was provided, the result is NULL.

Searched case expressions allow for conditional logic within an expression.
The evaluation process is as follows:

* The first WHEN condition is evaluated.
* If TRUE, the result of this expression is the THEN expression.
* If not TRUE, subsequent WHEN clauses are evaluated in the same manner.
* If none of the WHEN clauses evaluate to TRUE, then the result of the expression is the ELSE expression.
* If no ELSE expression was provided, the result is NULL.

=== Example

The following example uses a CASE clause to handle documents that do not have a city listed.
This scans all hotels.
If a hotel has a city, it is provided in the result set.
If a hotel does not have a city, default text appears.

====
.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT 
CASE WHEN city
IS NOT NULL THEN city
ELSE "no-city-recorded"
END
AS city
FROM hotel
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
...
  {
    "city": "Eastwood"
  },
  {
    "city": "Oban"
  },
  {
    "city": "Oban"
  },
  {
    "city": "no-city-recorded"
  },
...

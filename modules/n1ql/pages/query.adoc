{description}

A database query is a request to retrieve or change data in your database. You use queries to work with your data for tasks such as:

* Aggregating data
* Creating, reading, updating, or deleting (CRUD) data
* Finding and summarizing information


== Choose the Right Service

[%header,cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| Service | Description 

| Query service
| Use the Query service for operational queries -- for example, the front-end queries behind every page display or navigation.

| Analytics service
| Use the Analytics service when you don't know every aspect of the query in advance -- for example, if the data access patterns change frequently, or you want to avoid creating an index for each data access pattern, or you want to run ad hoc queries for data exploration or visualization.

| Full Text Search service
| Use the Full Text Search service when you want to take advantage of natural-language querying.

== Query Language

You use a query language to construct queries that tell your service which data you want to retrieve or modify. 

Couchbase Capella uses a query language called {sqlpp}. 
The Couchbase implementation of {sqlpp} was formerly known as https://www.couchbase.com/products/n1ql[N1QL^] (pronounced "nickel").

{sqlpp} is an expressive, powerful, and complete SQL dialect for querying, transforming, and manipulating JSON data. 
Based on SQL, itâ€™s immediately familiar to developers who can quickly start developing rich applications.

:description: You can assign a data type to a field to tell the Search Service how to analyze its data. 

[abstract]
{description}

When you xref:create-type-mapping.adoc[create a type mapping for a child field], you need to set its data type. 

If you create a Search index and do not set a data type for a field, the Search Service automatically assigns a field data type.

The following field data types are available: 

|====
|Field Data Type |Description 

|text |The field contains a string. The string can contain numbers and special characters.

|number |The field contains a number. It does not contain any alphabetic characters. 

|datetime |The field contains a date/time value that matches the format of a xref:customize-index.adoc#date-time[Date/Time Parser] in the index. 

|boolean |The field contains a true or false value. 

|disabled | This field data type is deprecated. It's included for compatibility only. 

|geopoint a|

The field contains geopoint (latitude and longitude) data, represented as either: 

* A string, as two numeric values separated by a comma. 
* A string, as a geohash point. 
* An array, as two floating point integers. 
* A JSON object, with the properties `lon`/`lng` and `lat`.

|geoshape |The field contains a GeoJSON object. For more information about GeoJSON objects, see xref:server:fts:fts-supported-queries-geojson-spatial.adoc[].

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database. 

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* role for the bucket where you want to edit an index.  

* You've created an index.
For more information, see xref:create-search-index-ui.adoc[].
 
* You've logged in to the Couchbase Capella UI.

|Option |Description 

|Type Identifier |Change how the Search Service sets a document's type. For more information, see xref:set-type-identifier.adoc[].

|Default Type |Change the default type assigned to documents in the index. The default value is `_default`.

|[[default-analyzer]]Default Analyzer a|

Change the default analyzer assigned to type mappings in the index. 

For more information about the available default analyzers, see xref:default-analyzers-reference.adoc[].

For more information about how to create your own custom analyzer, see xref:create-custom-analyzer.adoc[].

|[[date-time]]Default Date/Time Parser |Change the default date/time parser used for date data. 

|[[all-field]]Default Field a|

When you xref:create-child-field.adoc[create a child field] in a type mapping, you can choose to include that field in an `_all` field. 

You can add fields to the `_all` field to search their contents without specifying their field name in your search query. 

Enter a value in the *Default Field* field to change the name of this default field. 

|Store Dynamic Fields |Select *Store Dynamic Fields* to include field values in search results from a xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[dynamic type mapping] in the index.

Set the number of replicas that the Search Service creates for the index. 

For more information about replication and the Search Service, see xref:server:fts:fts-high-availability-for-search.adoc[] in the Couchbase Server documentation.

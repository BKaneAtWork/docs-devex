== Prerequisites 

* You've deployed the Search Service on a node in your database. 

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database. 

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* role for the bucket where you want to edit an index.  

* You've created an index.
For more information, see xref:create-search-index-ui.adoc[].
 
* You've logged in to the Couchbase Capella UI. 

== Procedure 

To set general settings for a Search index: 

. On the *Databases* page, select the database that has the Search index you want to edit. 
. Go to menu:Data Tools[Search].
. Click the index you want to edit.
. Expand *Advanced Configuration*.  
. Expand *General Settings*. 
. Configure any of the following general settings for your index: 
|====
|Option |Description 

|Type Identifier |Change how the Search Service sets a document's type. For more information, see xref:set-type-identifier.adoc[].

|Default Type |Change the default type assigned to documents in the index. The default value is `_default`.

|Default Analyzer a|

Change the default analyzer assigned to type mappings in the index. 

For more information about the available default analyzers, see xref:default-analyzers-reference.adoc[].

|Default Date/Time Parser |Change the default date/time parser used for date data. 

|[[all-field]]Default Field a|

When you xref:create-child-field.adoc[create a child field] in a type mapping, you can choose to include that field in an `_all` field. 

You can add fields to the `_all` field to search their contents without specifying their field name in your search query. 

Enter a value in the *Default Field* field to change the name of this default field. 

|Store Dynamic Fields |Select *Store Dynamic Fields* to include field values in search results from a xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[dynamic type mapping] in the index.

|DocValues for Dynamic Fields |Select *DocValues for Dynamic Fields* to include the values of each field from a xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[dynamic type mapping] in the index.

|Index Replicas a|

Set the number of replicas that the Search Service creates for the index. 

For more information about replication and the Search Service, see xref:[].

|Index Type |This setting is included for compatibility only. For new indexes, this setting is always *Version 6.0 (Scorch)*.

|Index Partitions |Enter a number greater than one to divide the index into partitions across multiple nodes running the Search Service.

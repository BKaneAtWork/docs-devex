The Search Service uses Search indexes and Search queries to collect and return content from documents in your database. 

== Search Indexes

A Search index tells the Search Service what content to use from documents in your database for Search queries.
You can choose to exclude content to improve search performance and improve the relevance of search results.

You can create a Search index xref:create-search-index-ui.adoc[with the UI] or xref:create-search-index-rest-api.adoc[from the REST API]. 

== Search Queries 

A Search query tells the Search Service what to search for in the contents of a Search index. 

Run a Search query xref:simple-search-ui.adoc[with the UI] or xref:simple-search-rest-api.adoc[from the REST API].

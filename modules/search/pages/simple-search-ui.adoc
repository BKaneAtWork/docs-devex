:page-topic-type: guide

== Prerequisites 

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database. 

* Your user account has the `Search Admin` or `Search Reader` role. 

* You've created a Search index.

For more information about how to create a Search index, see xref:search/create-search-index-ui.adoc[].

* You've logged in to the Couchbase Server Web Console. 

== Procedure 

To run a simple search with the Web Console: 

. Go to *Search*.
. Click the index where you want to run a search.
. In the *Search this index* field, enter a search query.

For example, the following query searches for the strings `view`, `food`, and `beach`:

The query payload enables scoring explanations and term highlighting. It also returns all available fields in the index, and returns 10 results per page.

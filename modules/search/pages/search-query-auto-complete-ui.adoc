:description: Create a Search index and run a Search query with the Web Console to test autocomplete with the Search Service.

[abstract]
{description}

== Prerequisites 

* You've deployed the Search Service on a node in your database. 

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database. 

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* role for the bucket where you want to create the index. 

* You've logged in to the Couchbase Server Web Console. 
 

== Procedure 

To use autocomplete with the Search Service, you need to create a Search index with two custom analyzers.

Then, you can run a test Search query from the Web Console. 

[#search-index]
=== Create the Autocomplete Search Index

To create the Search index:

. Go to *Search*.
. Click btn:[Add Index].
. In the *Index Name* field, enter a name for the new index. 
. In the *Bucket* list, select the bucket where you want to create the index. 
. Expand *Customize Index*. 
. Select *Use non-default scope/collection(s)*. 
. In the *Scope* list, select the scope where you want to create the index.

.. In the *Tokenizer* list, select *single*. 
.. In the *Token Filters* list, select and add the *to_lower* token filter. 
. Expand *Custom Filters*. 
. xref:create-custom-token-filter.adoc#edge-ngram[Create a custom token filter] with the following settings: 
.. In the *Name* field, enter `edge_ngram_2_8`.
.. In the *Type* list, select *edge_ngram*. 
.. In the *Min* field, enter `2`.
.. In the *Max* field, enter `8`.
. xref:create-custom-analyzer.adoc[Create another custom analyzer] with the following settings:

.. Select *only index specified fields*. 
. xref:create-child-field.adoc[] with the following settings:
.. In the *field* field, enter the name of a text field in a document from your selected scope and collection. 
.. In the *analyzer* list, select your *edge_ngram* analyzer. 
.. Select *index*.

.. Select *include in _all field*. 
. Expand *Advanced*. 
. In the *Default Analyzer* list, select your *keyword_to_lower* analyzer.

[#run-query]
=== Run A Search Query

To run a search query against the Search index from the Web Console: 

. xref:simple-search-ui.adoc[Run a search] with the <<search-index,Autocomplete Search index>> and enter 2-8 characters to use to generate auto-completed search results. 

The Search Service returns documents that could autocomplete the query you entered in the *Search* field.

{description}

== Prerequisites 

* You've deployed the Search Service on a node in your database. 

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database. 

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* role for the bucket where you want to create the index. 

* You've logged in to the Couchbase Capella UI. 
 

== Procedure 

You can create a compatible Search index with the <<ui,Capella UI>> or the <<api,REST API>>.

=== Create an Autocomplete Search Index with the Capella UI

To create the Search index with the Capella UI:

. On the *Databases* page, select the database where you want to create the Search index. 
. Go to menu:Data Tools[Search].
. Click btn:[Create Search Index].
. In the *Index Name* field, enter a name for the Search index. 
+
NOTE: Your index name must start with an alphabetic character (a-z or A-Z). It can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, or 0-9), hyphens (-), or underscores (_).
. Expand *Analyzers*. 
. xref:create-custom-analyzer.adoc[] with the following settings:
.. In the *Name* field, enter `keyword_to_lower`.
.. In the *Tokenizer* list, select *single*. 
.. In the *Token Filters* list, select and add the *to_lower* token filter. 
. Expand *Custom Filters*. 
. xref:create-custom-token-filter.adoc#edge-ngram[Create a custom token filter] with the following settings: 
.. In the *Name* field, enter `edge_ngram_2_8`. 
.. In the *Type* list, select *edge_ngram*.
.. In the *Min* box, enter `2`, or the minimum number of characters you want the Search index to use for autocomplete.
.. In the *Max* box, enter `8`, or the maximum number of characters you want the Search index to use for autocomplete.
. xref:create-custom-analyzer.adoc[Create another custom analyzer] with the following settings:
.. In the *Name* field, enter `edge_ngram`.
.. In the *Tokenizer* list, select *unicode*.  
.. In the *Token Filters* list, click both the *to_lower* and your custom *edge_ngram_2_8* token filter.
. xref:create-type-mapping.adoc[] with the following settings: 
.. Clear *index all contained fields*.
. (Optional) If the field you want to search with autocomplete is nested inside a JSON object in your documents, xref:create-child-mapping.adoc[] for the JSON object with the following settings: 
.. Clear *index all contained fields*.
. Under the type mapping or child mapping, xref:create-child-field.adoc[] with the following settings:
.. In the *Field* field, enter the name of a text field in a document from your selected scope and collection. 
.. In the *Analyzer* list, select your *edge_ngram* analyzer. 
.. Select *Index*.
.. Select *Store*. 
.. Select *Include in _all field*. 
. Expand *General Settings*. 
. In the *Default Analyzer* list, select your *keyword_to_lower* analyzer. 
. Click btn:[Create Index]

TIP: You can use the generated index definition JSON payload from the UI to create a Search index with the REST API. To view the generated JSON, click btn:[Index Definition].

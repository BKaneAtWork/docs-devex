{description}

== Prerequisites 

* You've deployed the Search Service on a node in your database. 

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database. 

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* role for the bucket where you want to create the index. 

* You've logged in to the Couchbase Capella UI. 
 

== Procedure 

To use autocomplete with the Search Service, you need to <<search-index,create a Search index with two custom analyzers>>.

Then, you can <<run-query,run a test Search query from the Web Console>>.  

[#search-index]

=== Run A Search Query

To run a search query against the Search index from the Capella UI: 

. xref:simple-search-ui.adoc[Run a search] with the <<search-index,Autocomplete Search index>> and enter 2-8 characters to use to generate auto-completed search results. 

The Search Service returns documents that could autocomplete the query you entered in the *Search* field.

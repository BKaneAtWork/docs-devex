{description}

Also known as auto suggest or type-ahead, autocomplete guesses potential matches for a user's search input as they type. 

Autocomplete can provide a better user experience with search in your application. 

To use autocomplete with the Search Service: 

. Create a compatible Search index. 
You can create the index xref:search-query-auto-complete-ui.adoc#search-index[with the UI] or xref:search-query-auto-complete-code.adoc[with the REST API].
. Test the index xref:search-query-auto-complete-ui.adoc#run-query[with the UI] or xref:search-query-auto-complete-code.adoc[with the REST API].
. Configure your application to return results from the Search Service. 
For example code, see xref:search-query-autocomplete-code.adoc[].

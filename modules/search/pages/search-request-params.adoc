{description}

The following is an example Search request: 

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-search-full-request.jsonc[tag=full]
----

A Search request can contain the following properties: 

[cols="1,1,1,4"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|query |Object |Yes a|

An object that contains the properties for one of the supported query types: 

* xref:server:fts:fts-supported-queries-query-string-query.adoc[]
* xref:server:fts:fts-supported-queries-match.adoc[]
* xref:server:fts:fts-supported-queries-match-phrase.adoc[]
* xref:server:fts:fts-supported-queries-non-analytic-query.adoc[]
* xref:server:fts:fts-supported-queries-compound-query.adoc[]
* xref:server:fts:fts-supported-queries-range-query.adoc[]
* xref:server:fts:fts-supported-queries-geospatial.adoc[]
* xref:server:fts:fts-supported-queries-special-query.adoc[]

|ctl |Object |No a|

An object that contains properties for query consistency. 

For more information about how to configure Search query consistency inside the `ctl` object, see <<ctl,>>.

|size/limit |Integer |No a|

Set the total number of results to return for a single page of search results. 

If you provide both the `size` and `limit` properties, the Search Service uses the `size` value.

|from/offset |Integer |No a|

Set an offset value to change where pagination starts for search results, based on the Search query's <<sort,>>. 

For example, if you set a `size` value of `5` and a `from` value of `10`, the Search query returns results 11 through 15 on a page. 

If you provide both the `from` and `offset` properties, the Search Service uses the `from` value.

|highlight |Object |No a|

Contains properties to control search result highlighting.

For more information about how to configure highlighting in Search results, see <<highlight,>>.

|fields |Array |No a|

An array of strings to specify each indexed field you want to return in search results. 

You must add a field and its contents to a Search index to view it in search results or add it to the `fields` array.

|[[facets]]facets |Object |No a|

Contains `\{facet-name\}` objects to define each facet you want to return with search results. 

The Search Service supports the following facet types: 

* *Term Facet*: Counts the documents that have the same value for a specified field. 
* *Numeric Range Facet*: Counts the documents with numeric field values that are greater than or less than a specified range or ranges. 
* *Date Range Facet*: Counts the documents with date field values that are earlier or later than a specified range or ranges. 

For more information, about how to configure the different facet types inside the `facets` object, see <<facet-name,>>.

|explain |Boolean |No a|

To create an explanation for a search result's score in search results, set `explain` to `true`.

To turn off explanations for search result scoring, set `explain` to `false`.

|sort |Array |No a|

Contains an array of strings or JSON objects to set how to sort search results. 

The strings can be: 

* `{field_name}`: Specify the name of a field to use to sort the search results.
* `_id`: Use the document's identifier to sort the search results. 
* `_score`: Use the document's score from the Search query to sort the search results.

For more information about the properties for a `sort` JSON object, see <<sort,>>.

|[[includelocations]]includeLocations |Boolean |No a|

To return the position of each occurrence of a search term inside a document, set `includeLocations` to `true`. 

NOTE: You must have *Include Term Vectors* enabled or the `include_term_vectors` property set to `true` on a field to use `includeLocations`.

To turn off term locations, set `includeLocations` to `false`.

|score |String |No a|

To turn off document relevancy scoring in search results, set `score` to `none`.

To turn on document relevancy scoring in search results, remove the `score` property.

|search_after |Array |No a|

NOTE: If you use `search_after` in a search request, you can't use `search_before`. Both properties are included in the example code to show the correct syntax.

Use `search_after` with `from/offset` and `sort` to control pagination in search results. 

Give a value for each string or JSON object in the `sort` array to the `search_after` array.
The Search Service starts search result pagination after the document with those values. 

You must provide the values in the same order that they appear in the `sort` array. 

For example, if you had a set of 10 documents to sort based on `_id` values of 1-10, with `from` set to `2` and `search_after` set to `8`, documents 9-10 appear on the same page. 

|search_before |Array |No a|

NOTE: If you use `search_before` in a search request, you can't use `search_after`. Both properties are included in the example code to show the correct syntax.

Use `search_before` with `from/offset` and `sort` to control pagination in search results.

Give a value for each string or JSON object in the `sort` array to the `search_before` array.
The Search Service starts search result pagination before the document with those values. 

You must provide the values in the same order that they appear in the `sort` array. 

For example, if you had a set of 10 documents to sort based on `_id` values of 1-10, with `from` set to `2` and `search_before` set to `8`, documents 2-6 appear on the same page. 

|collections |Array |No |Contains an array of strings that specify the collections where you want to run the query. 

|====

[#ctl]
== Ctl Object 

Use the `ctl` object to make sure that the Search Service runs your Search query against the latest version of the documents in your database. 

The `ctl` object and its properties cause the Search Service to run your query against the latest version of a document written to a xref:server:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/vbuckets.adoc[vBucket].  
The Search Service uses a consistency vector to synchronize the last document write to a vBucket from the Data Service with the Search index.

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-search-full-request.jsonc[tag=ctl]
----

The `ctl` object contains the following properties:

[cols="1,1,1,4"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|timeout |Integer |No a|

Set the maximum time, in milliseconds, that a Search query can execute on a Search index partition. 

If the query time exceeds the `timeout`, the Search Service cancels the query. 
The query might return partial results if any index partitions responded before the timeout.

|consistency |Object |Yes a|

An object that contains a `vectors` object and the `level` and `results` properties.

For more information, see <<consistency,>>.

|====

[#consistency]
=== Consistency Object 

Use the `consistency` object to control the consistency behavior for a Search index: 

[source,json]
include::example$run-search-full-request.jsonc[tag=consistency]

A `consistency` object has the following properties:

[cols="1,1,1,4"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|vectors |Object |Yes a|

An object that contains a \{search-index-name\} object for each Search index in the query.

For more information about the \{search-index-name\} object, see <<vectors,>>.

|level |String |Yes a|

Set the consistency to bounded or unbounded consistency: 

* `at_plus`: The Search query executes but requires that the Search index matches the timestamp of the last document update. 
You must provide a `vectors` object 
* `not_bounded`: The Search query executes without a consistency requirement. 
`not_bounded` is faster than `at_plus`, as it doesn't rely on a `vectors` object or wait for the Search index to match the Data Service index.

|results |String |No a|

To display an error instead of partial results if any index partitions are unavailable on a node, set `results` to `complete`.

To return partial results from a query if a node is unreachable, remove the `results` property.

|====

[#vectors]
==== \{search-index-name\} Object 

Use a `\{search-index-name\}` object to set the Search index and consistency vectors for a Search query.

The `\{search-index-name\}` object contains a vBucket mapping and UUID property with the sequence number for each update to a vBucket's data that you want to include in your search results:

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-search-full-request.jsonc[tag=vectors]
----

If your Search query uses an xref:server:fts:fts-creating-full-text-aliases.adoc[index alias] that references multiple Search indexes, you must include a `\{search-index-name\}` object for each Search index in the alias. 

To get the vBucket mapping, UUID, and the sequence number for a data write, use a `MutationToken` from a Data Service `MutationResult`. 
The Data Service returns a `MutationResult` object or promise for CRUD operations.
For more information, see xref:server:guides:kv-operations.adoc[].

For examples on how to obtain and use a `MutationToken` with the Couchbase SDKs, see:

 | xref:scala-sdk:howtos:full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc#consistency[Scala]

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|\{search-index-name\} |Object |Yes a|

The name of the Search index that you want to search and use with consistency. 

The \{search-index-name\} object contains a \{vBucketMapping\}/\{vBucketUUID\} property for each document write operation that you want in your search results.

Set the value of the property to the sequence number for the write operation. 

For example, if you had a property of `607/205096593892159": 2`, the Search Service looks for a write operation on vBucket `607`, with a UUID of `205096593892159`, with sequence number `2`.

|====


[#highlight]
== Highlight Object 

Use the `highlight` object to control how the Search Service highlights matches in search results. 

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-search-full-request.jsonc[tag=highlight]
----

[cols="1,1,1,4"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|style |String |No a|

Sets how the Search Service highlights a match from a search query: 

* `ansi`: The Search Service highlights matches with a yellow background (\u001b[43m).
* `html`: The Search Service surrounds matches with `<mark>` and `</mark>` HTML tags. 

|fields |Array |No a|

Contains an array of strings for each field name where you want to highlight a search query match. 

If you include the `fields` array, the Search Service only highlights fields that are in the array.

|====

[#facet-name]
== \{facet-name\} Object

Use a `\{facet-name\}` object to create a search facet.

You can have multiple `\{facet-name\}` objects inside the <<facets,facets object>> in your search query.

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-search-full-request.jsonc[tag=facets]
----

A `\{facet-name\}` object contains the following properties: 

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|size |Integer |Yes a|

Set the total number of categories to return with the search results for a Term facet. 

The Search Service orders facet categories from values with the most occurrences to the least occurrences. 

For Numeric Range and Date Range facets, the total number of categories returned depends on the number of ranges defined for the facet. 

|field |String |Yes |The name of the field to use to collect facet information. 

|numeric_ranges |Array |No a|

If you want to collect a Numeric Range facet, add a `numeric_ranges` array. 

A `numeric_ranges` array contains objects that define each numeric range you want to collect with your search results. 

For more information, see <<numeric,>>.

|date_ranges |Array |No a|

If you want to collect a Date Range facet, add a `date_ranges` array. 

A `date_ranges` array contains objects that define each date range you want to collect with your search results. 

For more information, see <<date,>>.

|====

[#numeric]
=== Numeric_ranges Array Objects

The objects in a `numeric_ranges` array specify the range or ranges for a Numeric Range facet. 

For example, the following `numeric_ranges` array sets two ranges, `high` and `low`, to collect for a Numeric Range facet: 

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-search-full-request.jsonc[tag=numeric_ranges]
----

The Search query increments the `count` property for `high` when the value of the `field` in the <<facet-name,>> is greater than 7 but less than 10. 

If the document's `field` value is less than 7 but greater than 0, the query increments the `count` value for `low`.
 
You can set both a `min` and `max` for a range, or just a `min` or `max`.

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|name |String |Yes |The name for the numeric range. 

|min |Integer |No a|

The minimum value to compare against the value of the `field` in the <<facet-name,>>. 

If a document's value for the field is greater than `min`, the Search Service increments the `count` value returned in the Search query results.

You can also define a `max` property to set an upper limit for your numeric range. 

|max |Integer |No a|

The maximum value to compare against the value of the `field` in the <<facet-name,>>. 

If a document's value for the field is less than `max`, the Search Service increments the `count` value returned in the Search query results.

You can also define a `min` property to set a lower limit for your numeric range.

|====

[#date]
=== Date_ranges Array Objects

The objects in a `date_ranges` array specify the range or ranges for a Date Range facet. 

For example, the following `date_ranges` array sets two ranges, `old` and `new`, to collect for a Date Range facet: 

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-search-full-request.jsonc[tag=date_ranges]
----

The Search query increments the `count` property for `old` when the value of the `field` in the <<facet-name,>> is later than `2020-12-31` but earlier than `2023-12-31`. 

If the document's `field` value is later than `2023-12-31` but earlier than `2024-12-31`, the query increments the `count` value for `new`.
 
You can set both a `start` and `end` for a range, or just a `start` or `end`.

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|name |String |Yes |The name for the date range. 

|start |RFC-3339 formatted Date String |No a|

The starting date value to compare against the value of the `field` in the <<facet-name,>>. 

If a document's value for the field is later than `start`, the Search Service increments the `count` value returned in the Search query results.

You can also define a `end` property to set an upper limit for your date range. 

|end |RFC-3339 formatted Date String |No a|

The ending date value to compare against the value of the `field` in the <<facet-name,>>. 

If a document's value for the field is earlier than `end`, the Search Service increments the `count` value returned in the Search query results.

You can also define a `start` property to set a lower limit for your date range.

|====

[#sort]
== Sort Object 

Use the `sort` object to control how the Search Service sorts search results. 

The following `sort` object orders search results by the values in `field1`, then by `field2`, the document's score, and then the document's ID value: 

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-search-full-request.jsonc[tag=sort]
----

The `sort` object can contain the following string values: 

[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Value |Description 

|\{field_name\} a|

The name of a field in the Search index. The Search Service sorts documents based on the value of the field, in ascending order.  

To sort in descending order based on a `{field-name}`, add a hyphen (-) to the start of the field name string.

|_id a|

The Search Service sorts documents based on their identifier value, in ascending order. 

To sort in descending order based on a document's ID value, add a hyphen (-) before the underscore (_) in the `_id` string. 

|_score a|

The Search Service sorts documents based on their score value, in ascending order. 

To sort in descending order based on a document's score, add a hyphen (-) before the underscore (_) in the `_score` string. 

|====

To customize search result sorting beyond ascending and descending values, use a JSON object. 

JSON objects in a `sort` object can contain the following properties: 

[cols="1,1,1,4"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description 

|by |String |Yes a|

Sets what value to use for the sort: 

* `id`: Uses the document's ID value. 
* `score`: Uses the document's score. 
* `field`: Uses the value of a specific field to sort. See <<field,field>>.

|[[field]]field |String |No |When `by` is set to `field`, specify the name of the field to use to sort search results.

|desc |Boolean |Yes a|

To sort the values in the field in descending order, set `desc` to `true`.

To sort the values in the field in ascending order, set `desc` to `false`.

|mode |String |Yes a|

Set the order for search results when the `field` contains multiple values, such as an array: 

* `default`: Use the first value in the field as the sort key. 
* `min`: Use the smallest value in the field as the sort key. 
* `max`: Use the largest value in the field as the sort key. 

|missing |String |Yes a|

Set how the Search Service sorts documents that don't have a value for the field specified in `field`:

* `first`: Documents with a missing value appear first and before other results in search results. 
* `last`: Documents with a missing value appear last and after other results in search results. 

|type |String |Yes a|

Set the data type of the field specified in `field`:

* `string`: The field contains a string. 
* `date`: The field contains date/time data. 
* `number`: The field contains a number or geographic data, like a latitude or longitude value.

Documenting All Couchbase Integrations

Replacing https://developer.couchbase.com/open-source-projects/ with a page in the docs, to reflect and promote Couchbase’s reach across a broad ecosystem of platforms, tools, and integrations.


Note, we have individual pages already for integrations for two of our SDKs:
https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/project-docs/third-party-integrations.html
https://docs.couchbase.com/ruby-sdk/current/project-docs/third-party-integrations.html
…which give a model for how we deal with mentioning unsupported projects in the docs.

The first task is to assemble a list of all of the integrations to include, and a little information on the level of support, and likely future viability of each project.

Third-party and community products and integrations -- 
although not by and large supported by Couchbase --
are a vital tool for most larger development projects.

[connected-ecosystem?????]
== Connected Ecosystem


Couchbase develops and supports connectors for:
* Elasticsearch and OpenSearch
* The Kafka Connect Framework
* Apache Spark Data Processing Platform
* The Tableau interactive data visualization platform

Couchbase ODBC and JDBC drivers enable any application based on the ODBC/JDBC standards, for example Microsoft Excel, QlikView, or SAP Lumira, as well as Tableau, to connect to a Couchbase Server or cluster.

[#sdk-language-ecosystem]
== SDK Language Ecosystem

Couchbase has SDKs in ten popular languages --
xref:c-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[C], 
xref:dotnet-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[C# (.NET)], 
xref:go-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Go], 
xref:java-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Java], 
xref:kotlin-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Kotlin], 
xref:nodejs-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Node.js], 
xref:php-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[PHP], 
xref:python-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Python], 
xref:ruby-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Ruby], and 
xref:scala-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Scala].

If you develop in one of these languages, you may be interested in (or already using) other libraries in that language's ecosystem, and wondering if it will integrate with Couchbase.

There are too many third party integrations to evaluate and list (and absence of a mention in these pages is no judgement on importance or quality), but the following are well worth investigating:


=== JVM SDKs


The JVM SDKs -- Java, Kotlin, and Scala -- can all benefit from the same integrations.
Thus 


Apache Camel Quarkus
Apache Camel with CData JDBC Driver for Couchbase
(Talend? Spring Boot?) https://github.com/Talend/apache-camel/blob/master/components/camel-couchbase/src/main/docs/couchbase-component.adoc

https://www.jhipster.tech/using-couchbase/
// from their site:
////
When Couchbase is selected:

Spring Data Couchbase will be used to access the database. This is very close to Spring Data JPA, and this is why Couchbase support is very close to the (default) JPA support
Couchmove is used instead of Liquibase to manage database changes
The entity sub-generator will not ask you for entity relationships, as you can’t have relationships with a NoSQL database (at least not in the way you have relationships with JPA)
Couchbase Testcontainers is used to launch a containerized version of the database for running unit tests.
////


The Couchbase Java SDK is a first class citizen in the https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-couchbase[Spring Data] world, and there are many examples of using the SDK with https://blog.couchbase.com/couchbase-spring-boot-spring-data/[Spring Boot] and Spring Data (and Spring Data JPA).

Couchbase also supports integrating with xref:3.2@spark-connector:ROOT:java-api.adoc[Spark].


Many dataflow tools integrate with Couchbase, including https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-couchbase-bundle[Apache NiFi], 
https://wildfly-extras.github.io/wildfly-camel/#_camel_couchbase[Apache Camel],
and https://github.com/couchbaselabs/flink-connector-couchbase[Apache Flink].
Why not make development easier, and use https://blog.couchbase.com/create-a-zeppelin-interpreter-for-couchbase/[Apache Zeppelin]?


==== SQL Migration

https://github.com/differentway/couchmove[Couchmove] is an open-source Java migration tool for Couchbase, inspired by Flyway.
It can help you "track, manage and apply changes, in your Couchbase buckets."
The philosophy of the project claims to "strongly favor simplicity and convention over configuration".

In CouchMove you write your migrations in {sqlpp_url}[{sqlpp} (formerly N1QL)], while in https://github.com/couchbaselabs/CouchVersion[CouchVersion] you can write them using the Java SDK, which essentially allow you to create more complex migrations.
CouchVersion provides a new approach for adding changes (change sets) based on Java classes and methods with appropriate annotations.

// Micronaut Framework is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language.
https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core

So Is the community project linked (https://github.com/friendsofcat/laravel-couchbase ) in ticket  description the one that you were referring to or is this https://github.com/ytake/Laravel-Couchbase the one you were thinking about. The latter has Sergey Avseyev  involved but not updated for a while.

** Python
** Ruby

==== Ruby

The Couchbase Ruby SDK integrates well with Ruby-on-Rails, particularly for use as a https://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#cache-stores[Rails Cache Store^].


=== Interactive Shells

Couchbase Shell (cbsh) -- in Developer Preview -- is an interactive shell, based upon nushell, which you can use to extract, transform, and load different data formatsin Couchbase.

You can also use IDEs interactively with Couchbase, through our VS Code and JetBrains plugins, <<partner-integrations-with-couchbase,see above>>.


Some languages, such as Ruby, come with REPLs (interactive shells) as standard -- as is normal with functional programming languages.
Others have them available as _Notebooks_, such as Python, with https://jupyter.org/[Jupyter Notebook] (which works with _several_ different languages), through which you can interactively develop functionality for a Couchbase app, or blend with analytic tools and charts.
